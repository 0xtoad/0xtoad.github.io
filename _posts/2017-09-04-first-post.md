# Hello World '

###### Obligatory first post...

This is the beginning ~~somewhat~~ of my trials in digital security, pentesting, web hosting and anything else I feel like writing about!! Some harder than others. Writing about this stuff will be new too!

I don’t expect many people to stumble upon this “blog”, but if you do I hope you find something useful.

For starters I plan on making a few posts about current web vulnerabilities, just to make sure I understand them in depth, nothing that can’t be found elsewhere will be writing here for the time being or maybe ever, don’t expect too much.

Thank you!
